            <p class="project-description">
                A demo, short for "demonstration," is a concise presentation or trial run of a product, service, or concept designed to showcase its key features and functionality. 
                Demos are commonly used in various industries, including software development, marketing, and sales, to offer a glimpse of what a final product or service will look like. 
                They are a powerful tool for conveying the value and capabilities of a product to potential customers, investors, or stakeholders.

            <p class="project-description">
                LA memory game is a popular and engaging educational or recreational activity that challenges players to test and enhance their memory skills. 
                It typically consists of a set of cards or tiles, each with a matching pair, which are initially arranged face-down. 
                Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, with the goal of finding matching pairs by remembering the location of each card they've seen. 
                Successful matches are removed from the game, and the player with the most pairs at the end wins
